You actually did it.
I suppose I should thank you. It is rare to see souls who don’t hoard everything they can for themselves nowadays.
You’ve taught yourself a valuable lesson, Riham.
Do not forget it. For this same lesson may have been the fruit of a fun two days between friends…
...but it was also a thought-out message that they wanted to share with the world.
Do not always take. Learn to give.
Well, you already know - it is pointless to keep talking.
Goodbye, hunter.
